# LoadCal

## What Does the Program Do?

- This program calculates how many boxes can be load in the container which you entered dimensions.
- This program determines how many box(es) should be fitted transverse and how many box(es) should be fitted longitudinal along the container width to load max boxes qty.
- If there is a gap more than the box width at the end of the container the program **doesn't** calculate how many box(es) can be load the gap. It can be added the program.
